# Dice Game Project
This project is a JavaScript game developed during a course by me and the teacher Jonas Schmedtmann. The game is a fast-paced, thrilling competition between two players, where players take turns rolling the dice, and the number of rolls they can make is determined by luck.

## Game Rules
In this game, players roll a dice on their turn, with the number on the dice indicating how many points they have earned. Players can roll the dice as many times as they wish until they choose to "hold" or until they roll a 1. If a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points they have accumulated, and it becomes their opponent's turn. However, if they choose to "hold," their points are saved, and their turn ends. The game continues until one player reaches a score of 100, making it an intense race to the finish.

### Gameplay
To start playing the game, players can simply click on the "Start Game" button. The game will display a modal where players can enter their names. Once the players have entered their names, they can click on the "Start" button to begin the game. Players can then click on the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice. After each roll, the player's score is updated, and they have the option to roll again or hold their points. If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends immediately, and their accumulated points are lost. On the other hand, if the player chooses to hold, their points are saved, and their turn ends. The game continues with the second player, and the process repeats until one of the players reaches a score of 100 or more, thus winning the game.

### Features
In addition to the gameplay described above, the game also includes the following features:

Open Modal: Players can click on the "Menu" button to open a modal where they can see the game rules and an "About Me" section.
